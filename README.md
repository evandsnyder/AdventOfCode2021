# Advent of Code 2021

This year, I am working with with C++ to solve each challenges.
The application can be built and run as follows:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
./bin/AdventOfCode2021
```

There are some launch arguments that might be useful:
```
-a : executes all challenges
#  : If you enter a number or series of numbers, those specific challenges will be executed
```
If no argument is provided, the program will attempt to execute the challenge for the current day
